### WARNING: DO NOT EAT the transparent raspberries!

### What you need
- A handful of raspberries.
- Dishwashing soap
- Bleach

### How long it takes
- five to six days.

### How to do it
- Day 1: Make a dishwashing soap solution by taking 10 ml soap and filling up to 100 ml water. For best results the soap itself should be a clear liquid. Put the raspberries in the solution and let them rest for 2 days
- Day 3: You will see that the solution has turned red. Discard it at replace it with another 100 ml of fresh soap solution as on day one.
- Day 4: The solution will have turned red again. Discard it and this time replace it with a solution of 10 ml household bleach, filled up to 100ml of water
- Day 5: Check if all the raspberries have turned transparent. If not, wait one more day. You can also add 5-10 ml of pure bleach to the solution, but be careful. Too much bleach will make the raspberries desintegrate.

You are done. DO NOT EAT the transparent raspberries.
