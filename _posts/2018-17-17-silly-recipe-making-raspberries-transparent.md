### WARNING: The transparent raspberries won't be edible anymore. Do not eat them!

### What you need
- A handful of raspberries.
- Dish soap
- Bleach

### How long it takes
- five to seven days.

### How to do it
- Make saltwater by mixing 3g of salt into 100 mL of water
- Put aside one sardine to make the culturing broth for the bacteria
- Put 2-3 sardines in a deep plate, add saltwater so they are half covered only, put the plate in the fridge. The bacteria need oxygen, so do not cover the plate.
- Make the culturing broth by boiling one entire sardine in 1/2 L of water for 30-40 minutes. When done, discard the fish, fill up the broth with boiling water so you have exactly 1/2 L, use a sif or a paper filter to get clear broth, which you can fill into glass jar #1. Now add 15g of salt to the jar and stir until dissolved. Let the broth cool for an hour or two, then store the jar in the fridge.
