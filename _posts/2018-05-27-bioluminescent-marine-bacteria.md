### What you need
- 3-4 fresh(ish) sardines. Deepfrozen fish will *not* work, so get them from a market or your supermarkets fresh fish counter. Any other saltwater fish should be ok too.
- Salt
- Deep plate
- 1-2 small glass jars


### How long it takes
- three to four days, depending on how fresh your fish is. The fresher the fish, the longer it will take for the bioluminescent bacteria to appear. No worries, they are harmless.




### The Result
