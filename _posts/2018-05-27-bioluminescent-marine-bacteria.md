### What you need
- 3-4 fresh(ish) sardines. Deepfrozen fish will *not* work, so get them from a market or your supermarkets fresh fish counter. Any other saltwater fish should be ok too.
- Salt
- Deep plate
- 2 glass jars
- Q-tips (cotton swabs)


### How long it takes
- Three to four days, depending on how fresh your fish is. If its very fresh, it will take longer for the bioluminescent bacteria to appear. No worries, they are harmless. The bad smell is caused by another type of bacteria.

### How to do it
- Make saltwater by mixing 3g of salt into 100 mL of water
- Put aside one sardine to make the culturing broth for the bacteria
- Put 2-3 sardines in a deep plate, add saltwater so they are half covered only, put the plate in the fridge. The bacteria need oxygen, so do not cover the plate.
- Make the culturing broth by boiling one entire sardine in 1/2 L of water for 30-40 minutes. When done, discard the fish, fill up the broth with boiling water so you have 1/2 L, use a sif or a paper filter to get clear broth, which you can fill into glass jar #1. Now add 15g of salt to the jar and stir until dissolved. Let the broth cool for an hour or two, then store the jar in the fridge.

- Now you need to wait until the bioluminescense appears on the sardines in the plate. This can take up to 4 days. Always keep everything in the fridge. If you change the saltwater every day, the fish won't start to smell bad as quickly. Check for small green/blue glowing spots. You will only see them in a dark room after your eyes have adapted to the darkness for about a minute or so. But again, it will take two days at least for that glow to appear. ![placeholder](/pic/biolumsardines/DSCI0597.JPG "The Sardines") ![placeholder](/pic/biolumsardines/DSCI0594-sardinen.JPG "The Very Faint Glow on the Sardines")

- When you see the first glowing spots, pour a small amount of the culturing broth from jar #1 into a new jar #2. This will be the one where you cultivate the bacteria. Take a Q-tip and gently dab some of the glowing spots until the tip is soaked, then inmerse the tip into jar #2 for some seconds and stir it around, so the bacteria are transferred to the broth. If you then add bacteria from a different glowing spot, use a new Q-tip. When done, put everything back into the fridge. The older the fish gets, the more glowing spots will appear and the brighter they will be, so repeat this several times, until you cannot stand the smell anymore :-) 

- Remeber that culture jar #2 should not be covered or closed. The bacteria need oxygen to glow. You can "wake them up" by gently shaking the jar. Again, the glow will only be visible in a darkened room. You wont see it in the lit fridge.

- After you have thrown away the sardines, you can keep culturing the glowing bacteria in jar #2 for quite a while if every day you replace a small amount of broth with fresh broth from jar #1!
