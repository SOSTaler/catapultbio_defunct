### What you need
- 3-4 fresh(ish) sardines. Deepfrozen fish will *not* work, so get them from a market or your supermarkets fresh fish counter. Any other saltwater fish should be ok too.
- Salt
- Deep plate
- 2 glass jars
- Q-tips


### How long it takes
- three to four days, depending on how fresh your fish is. The fresher the fish, the longer it will take for the bioluminescent bacteria to appear. No worries, they are harmless.

### How to
- Make saltwater by mixing 3g of salt into 100 mL of water
- Put aside one sardine to make the broth for the bacteria
- Put 2-3 sardines in a deep plate, add saltwater so they are half covered only, put the plate in the fridge. The bacteria need oxygen, so do not cover the plate.
- Make the broth by boiling one entire sardine in 1/2 L of water for 30-40 minutes. When done, discard the fish, fill up the broth with boiling water so you have 1/2 L, use a sif or a paper filter to get clear broth, which you can fill into glass jar #1. Let the broth cool for an hour or two, then store the jar in the fridge.

Now you need to wait until the bioluminescense appears on the sardines in the plate. This can take up to 4 days. Always keep everything in the fridge. If you change the saltwater every day, the fish won't start to smell as quickly. Check for small green/blue glowing spots. You will only see them in a dark room after your eyes have adapted to the darkness for about a minute or so. But again, it will take two days at least for that glow to appear.
